                    <strong>The Alternating Current</strong>
                    <p class="text-justify" style="tab: size 5px;">When Tesla came to the United States, he worked for
                        Thomas Edison in Manhattan and was promised $50,000 if he could make Edison’s direct current
                        method successful. As it turned out, Edison’s DC current was not as effective as Tesla’s own
                        alternating current method in transmitting electricity over long distances. When Edison reneged
                        on his offer to pay Tesla to solve his DC power design flaws, Tesla quit and moved on to his
                        next endeavor.

                    <strong>The Tesla Coil</strong>
                    <p class="text-justify" style="tab: size 5px;">Perhaps the most familiar symbol of Tesla’s work is
                        the Tesla coil, embodied in the tower that was erected at what is now the last remaining
                        laboratory located in Shoreham, New York, the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe. Here, Tesla
                        created a tower topped by his infamous coils which shot electric sparks through the air and
                        circulated the electricity around the coils by alternating current.

                    <strong>Magnifying Transmitter</strong>
                    <p class="text-justify" style="tab: size 5px;">Building upon the revelations of the Tesla coil,
                        Tesla sought to offer wireless power for free to all by transmitting information from one tower
                        to another using resonance. The currents were sent from one circuit to the other, building in
                        frequency until lightning sparked from one tower to the other. By connecting a wire to the tower
                        and running it around his lab, he powered his laboratory wirelessly. He demonstrated the effect
                        on stage to audiences using light bulbs that were not connected to any power source. The
                        magnifying transmitter succeeded in transmitting an electrical current a kilometer away.

                    <strong>Tesla Turbine</strong>
                    <p class="text-justify" style="tab: size 5px;">Tesla developed a piston engine to power automobiles
                        using combustion to rotate disks. At the time, commonly used turbines were less efficient and
                        relied on blades. Tesla’s invention merged many disks to create a centrifugal pump. By moving
                        fluid in the path of least resistance, his turbine was more fuel-efficient.
